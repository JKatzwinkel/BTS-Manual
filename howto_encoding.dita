  <title>Encoding Inflection</title>
  <body>
    <p>To ecode the inflection, switch to the Sign Text Editor and activate the Lemmatizer. </p>
    <p>Assign an inflection code to each word form (token). The inflection codes apply to forms that
      are distinguished morphologically. It does not encode forms that depend on grammar theory,
      that means there is no differentation between morphological identical <i>s·∏èm=f</i>-Forms. For
      a list of codes see <xref href="grammar_inflection.dita"/>.</p>
    <p>Experience has learned that it is better to lemmatize a text first and afterwards fill out
      the field "Flexion". If you want to encode the inflection during the lemmatization process,
      type the approriate code (see <xref href="grammar_inflection.dita">Inflection codes</xref>)
      into the field "Flexion" before or after you have selected the lemma and than confirm with
        <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_zt4_fvf_fx"/>. If you choose
      to encode the inflection after you have finished the lemmatization (as we recommand), you can
      use the button <image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/flexion-confirm.png"
        id="image_zxg_dks_2x"/> to proceed to the next not yet inflected word. You can also use the
      ENTER key to confirm and proceed.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>NOTE: The button <image href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/flexion-confirm.png"
        id="image_p42_hvf_fx"/> brings you to the next word with default inflection code, i.e. if
      you defined "Default Inflexion = 3" in the preferences, the button brings you to the next word
      with inflection code 3, although you might already have entered this code as the correct
      form.</p>
