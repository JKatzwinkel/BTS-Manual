        <li>The <xref href="ui_workspace.dita">Workspace</xref> is a part of the BTS user interface
          where all database records are entered and processed. Differents contents are edited
          within the workspace, according to your mode of work, i.e. whether you edit texts, edit
          the lemma list, work on the thesauri or create abstact texts. The Text Corpus View, the
          Lemma View, the Thesaurus View and the Abstract Text View can be accessed via the toolbar.
          The workspace of each view is subdivided into four windows: the Navigator window
          (left/yellow), the Editor window (middle above/blue) and the Passport Editor window
          (middle below/green) and the Annotation window (right/red).</li>
