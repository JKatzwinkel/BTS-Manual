 <title>Open User Manager</title>
 <conbody>
  <p/>
  <p>NOTE: This menu item is only available to administrator. </p>
  <p>To all other user types it is greyed out. Clicking on this menu item opens the window "User
   Management" with two tabs "Manage Users and User Groups" and "Administrate User Roles and
   Rights".</p>
  <p><b><u>"Manage Users and User Groups" tab:</u></b></p>
  <p>"Manage Users and User Groups" tab offers the opportunity to create new users and add users to
   project groups, which have a specific set of rights in the editing process.</p>
  <p>In the tab <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/users.png" id="image_m5r_q5k_4r"/> "Active
   Users" the active user groups are displayed. In the tab "Bin" deleted user groups are shown. In
   the brackets behind the group names the number of the assigned users is displayed. Clicking on a
   group name will open the list of assigned users. The last entry in the list "_Orphans" shows on
   click all available users. </p>
  <p>Each group has an ID and a name which appear in the field on the right. For each group a "type"
   can also be given and there is a possibility to write a comment. Also on the right side, below
   the group data, there is a section for creating new individual members within the group: "Create
   New User". A username and a password are to be entered while creating a new user.  In the third
   section below there is a drop-down menu, where you can choose existing users and add them to the
   group by clicking on the "Add user to Group".</p>
  <p>Clicking on a username allows to modify his/her information on the right side of the window. It
   contains such fields as "ID of User", "First name" and "Surname" (both required fields marked
   with *), "Email", "Website", "Description", "Web Description", "Siglum" and "Comment". In the
   "ID" field a username given earlier appears, but cannot be edited anymore. Password of a user can
   be changed here (e.g. in the case that a user forgets his/her password). Users can also change
   own passwords any time (as long as they know their previous password). The checkbox "User is
   Database Administrator" can be checked.</p>
  <p/>
  <p>Functions of the buttons in this tab:</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/users-add.png" id="image_xgh_3vk_4r"/> "New Group" adds a
   new group to your list of groups. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png" id="image_tml_hxk_4r"/> "Delete" deletes the
   selected user and moves him into the bookmark <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/bin.png"
    id="image_tlk_kxk_4r"/>"Bin". </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/undo.png" id="image_sjs_sxk_4r"/> undo last action.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/redo.png" id="image_ldc_xxk_4r"/> redo last undone
   action. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/userrole-edit.png" id="image_bx3_cyk_4r"/> "Edit updaters
   of selected database object" opens the window, where you can assign either "Reader" or "Updater"
   role to a user in relation to the user group.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u><b>"Administrate User Roles and Rights" tab:</b></u></p>
  <p>The user role administration in BTS follows a certain procedure: Project -> DB Collection (ex.
   Corpus) -> User Role -> User Name. Which means that not a certain corpus and certain role are
   assigned to the user, but the other way round: first roles are assigned to a corpus and then
   users are assigned to these roles. </p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>1st Level: Projects</u></p>
  <p>A List of projects is displayed in the field on the left side. Upon clicking on a chosen
   project, its data will appear in the field on the right. The data includes: Project ID, Project
   Name, Project Prefix, Description, Connection Type, Server URL and DB Path. You can also click on
   the blue link below "Add Database Collection" and in the pop-up window give the name of the
   collection and check boxes "Synchronize Collection" and "Index Collection for Full Text Search"
   if needed. Clicking OK will add the collection to the chosen project and it will appear at the
   bottom after opening the project tree.</p>
  <p><u>2nd Level: DB Collections</u></p>
  <p>For each collection the data will also be displayed on the right. "DB Collection Name" is
   shown, but cannot be edited. Two checkboxes can be selected: "Synchronize with Server" and "Index
   Collection". Below is a drop-down menu "Create New Roles Description" where you can choose:
   admins, editors, researchers, transcribers or guest roles for the users. After choosing one
   option from the drop-down menu, click on the blue link "Add New User Roles Description" to add
   the role.</p>
  <p><u>3rd Level: User Roles</u></p>
  <p>In the tree on the left, the added roles will appear after expanding the collection. On the
   right, Role Name and User Role Definition (a description of tasks and rights) will appear, which
   cannot be changed. In the two fields below you can assign a user or a group to each role. At the
   bottom there is a blue link "Remove this Role and its members form DB collection". Clicking it
   will remove the chosen role from the collection on the left.</p>
  <p><u>4th Level: Users</u></p>
  <p>Expanding (clicking on) a role, users with the assigned roles will be displayed. Clicking on
   individual user will make their first name and surname to appear on the right, in the case where
   an entire group has a specific role, the name of the group will appear. You can remove users and
   groups from specific roles by clicking the blue link on the bottom "Remove Role from User" or
   "Remove Group from Role".</p>
