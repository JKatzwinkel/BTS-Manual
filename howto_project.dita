  <title>Creating / Editing a project</title>
  <body>
    <p>This menu item is only available to the user with global administrator privileges.</p>
    <p><b>Creating Project</b></p>
    <p>Select "File" > "New" > "New Project" in the menu bar. Selecting "New Project" will open the
      "Edit project name" window. To create a new project, enter "Project name", "Project prefix"
      and "Description". The project prefix is the internal name of the project, under which it will
      be saved in the database. Description is optional.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Do not use special characters, spaces, or capital letters in the project prefix. If you
      have entered invalid characters, the input field will turn red and the buttons "Next" and
      "Finish" will be inactive. </p>
    <p>NOTE: It is recommended not to click the "Finish" button until the last configuration window
      is displayed.</p>
    <p>The button "Next >" leads to the "Project Connection Settings" window. Here you can enter
      "Connection Type", "Server URL" and "Database Path". The standard connection type used by BTS
      is "couchdb". The server URL includes the URL and port number and currently is
      "http://aaew64.bbaw.de:9589/". Database path is left empty. </p>
    <p>Clicking on the "Next >" button again will display a "Project Feature" window to select among
      the features "Corpus Data", "Thesaurus Data", "Wordlist Data", and "Abstract Texts Data". We
      recommend to select all the check-boxes. </p>
    <p>A further click on "Next >" leads to the "Project Database Collection" window, in which the
      newly created databases can be added or the existing ones edited. Editing includes changing
      the database name or activating / deactivating synchronizing and indexing check-boxes. </p>
    <p>Confirm the creation of your project with the "Finish" button. To change or view information
      in the previous windows you can always click "&lt; Back". Cancel the creation of the new
      project with "Cancel". The project properties can always be modified later through the "Edit
      current project" menu.</p>
    <p><b>Editing a project</b></p>
    <p>Select "Edit" > "Edit New Project" in the menu bar. If you click on the "Edit current
      Project", a window comes up, where you can edit the current project's name and
      description.</p>
    <p>The Button "Next >" leads to the "Project Connection Settings" window. Here you can enter
      "Connection Type" (BTS uses "couchdb"), "Server URL" and "Database Path".</p>
    <p>Clicking on "Next >" will display a window with options to select additional features (Corpus
      Data, Thesaurus Data, Wordlist Data, Abstract Texts Data). Select the relevant check boxes and
      click "Next >". </p>
    <p>In the "Project Database Collection" window you can add the existing databases to the new
      project. You can edit the name of the collection by clicking the "Edit" button. </p>
    <p>Confirm the changes made to your project with "Finish". To go to the previous window you can
      always click "&lt; Back". Cancel all the changes with the "Cancel" button.</p>
