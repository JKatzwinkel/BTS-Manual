  <title>Open Futon / Elastic Search GUI</title>
  <body>
    <p>This feature is only available to users with administrator privileges.</p>
    <p>The administrator is enabled to open the futon and the "Elastic Search" graphic user
      interface via "Window" > "Open Futon" or "Window" > "Open ES GUI", respectively, in the menu
      bar.</p>
    <p><b>Open Futon</b></p>
    <p>Futon is a web-based GUI (graphic user interface), which provides a basic interface to the
      majority of the functionality of CouchDB. This is a "backdoor" to the database, allowing to
      create, update, delete and view documents and access the configuration parameters. It shows
      the source code of the database objects in JSON format.</p>
    <p>For details see: http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/intro/futon.html</p>
    <p><b>Open ES GUI</b></p>
    <p>This opens the "Elastic Search" graphic user interface with the standard internet browser. It
      allows to see the "backdoor" of the queries done in the BTS. </p>
