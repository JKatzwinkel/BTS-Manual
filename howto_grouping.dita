 <title>Grouping hieroglyphs</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Grouping hieroglyphs is a preferable, but not an essential task of the text editing process.
   Encoding the grouping enables analyses on the strategies and use of grouping. However, wether or
   not you encode the grouping, it is essential that you are aware of the sequence of hieroglphs,
   because this is crucial (1) for all further analyses of the data and (2) to search for words by
   the order of hieroglyphic signs (e.g. if you find a sequence of two hieroglyphs in a damaged text
   and want to look for words that would fit the lacuna). For details on the encoding of hieroglyphs
   and hieroglyphic groups see <xref href="guidelines_hieroglyphs.dita"/>.</p>
  <p><b>1. If you decide not to group hieroglyps</b>, use a hyphen between the single hieroglyphs.
   Encode the signs according to their sequence. For the BTS standards of defining the sequence see
   chapter 2.1 <xref href="Hieroglypheneingabe_Richtlinien.pdf" format="pdf"><image
     href="Images/icons/Adobe_PDF_file_icon_24x24.png" id="image_bxp_nzk_sx"/> Guidelines for the
    encoding of hieroglyphs</xref>.</p>
  <p><b>2. If you group hieroglyphs</b>, use ":" and "*". Grouping with "&amp;" is not allowed,
   because this has affection on the sequence of hieroglyphs, e.g. "d&amp;D" would indeed produce
   the correct appearance of the hieroglyphic group, but it would imply the sequence "d-D" for
   analyses in the database. Further, it is crucial that you work with the photos or facsimile of
   the original text. Publications containing hand- or computer-written hieroglyphs may present the
   hieroglyphs in a different order than the original text. If neither photo nor facsimile of your
   text is available, please refrain from grouping the hieroglyphs. </p>

  <p>NOTE: Due to technical reasons, columns have to be transcribed into lines.</p>
