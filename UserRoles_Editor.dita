  <title>Editor</title>
  <body>
    <p>Editors may review and correct database objects owned by other users even if no special
      rights for the database object were granted to them. Thus they can review and improve the
      quality of the data.</p>
    <p><b>Rights</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_v25_l4v_bt">
        <li>Can edit all items in a database, i.e. a corpus, a lemma list, or the thesaurus
          database, where editor rights assigned.</li>
        <li>Can add or remove database objects within a corpus.</li>
        <li>Can assign a Updater or Reader status to other users, but only for individual database
          objects.</li>
        <li>Can, technically, change the own status as a Reader or an Updater. This is irrelevant
          though, because the user role "Editor" takes precedence (as in the case of the
            Admin).<p>NOTE: These rights apply only for databse objects with visibility "project",
            "public", or "all authenticated". In all other intances, the editor has only access to
            the database objects if assigned as Updater or Reader.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_lwp_n4v_bt">
        <li>In case the corpus was created by someone else, Editors can modify individual database
          objects, but are attributed a guest role for the corpus itself (cannot edit the corpus
          passport data, or edit updaters/readers for an entire corpus). </li>
        <li>Cannot create new corpora within a project.</li>
      </ul>
