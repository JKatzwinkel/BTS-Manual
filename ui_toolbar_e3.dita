  <title>Toolbar </title>
  <body>
    <p>The Tool bar displays several icons. Tool-tips are displayed upon the mouse-over.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Toolbar_complete.png"
        id="image_rvd_tjp_5t"/></p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/add.png" id="image_izv_hlr_4r"/>
      <b>New</b>
    </p>
    <p>Click the black triangle on the right of the plus sign to open a context menu.</p>
    <p>Here you can choose between the entries to create a new corpus, a new text corpus object, a
      new text or an annotation. As long as you did not select a corpus in the Navigator window the
      entries in the context menu are disabled. </p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/save-all.png" id="image_n2f_tlr_4r"/>
      <b>Save</b>
    </p>
    <p>Save the changes you made in the currently active window or tab. As long as you did not work
      in the database object it will be inactive (grey) and after saving it will return to the
      inactive state. If you attempt to close the program the window will ask you to save your
      changes unless you already have done a save before. </p>
    <p>NOTE: There is no auto-save in BTS, but the program will save your file when you click on
      another database object. Make sure you save your work in regular intervals to avoid loss of
      input!</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/save.png" id="image_vgj_tmr_4r"/>
      <b>Save all</b></p>
    <p>Save all changes in all the database objects you have worked on.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/undo.png" id="image_rfb_wmr_4r"/>
      <b>Undo</b> (Ctrl+Z) </p>
    <p>Undo the last action. You can undo more than one action. The Undo-button only applies to
      changes in the Text Editor and can only undo actions you have done during the current session
      in the text. Once you have switched to another database object, the feature is not available
      anymore. Newly created database objects cannot be deleted this way.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/redo.png" id="image_ffc_mnr_4r"/>
      <b>Redo</b>
    </p>
    <p>Reverse last "undone" action, applies only to changes in the Text Editor.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_rkn_4nr_4r"/>
      <b>Preferences</b>
    </p>
    <p>This option is available twice on the toolbar and leads to Preferences (see <xref
        href="ui_preferences.dita"/>). </p>
    <p>Next to the cup <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/user.png" id="image_chv_5nr_4r"/> the
      name of the currently logged in user is shown. Next to pencil <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/edit.png" id="image_cbs_ynr_4r"/> and key <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/userrole.png" id="image_g5n_14r_4r"/> the user role is
      displayed. </p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/project.png" id="image_dn3_jm1_sr"/> displays the name
      of the current project.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/Open_Perspective.png" id="image_mdc_dkp_5t"/>
      <b>Open Perspective...</b>
    </p>
    <p>A pop-up window will appear with the list of four perspectives / views of the workspace (Text
      Corpus, Lemma, Thesaurus, Abstract Text). Select the respective perspective / view and confirm
      with "OK" to open it.</p>
    <p>You can also open <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/corpora.png" id="image_dry_hkp_5t"/>
      <i>Text Corpus</i>, <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmata.png" id="image_ecw_jkp_5t"/>
      <i>Lemma</i>, <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/thss.png" id="image_jxq_lkp_5t"/>
      <i>Thesaurus</i> and <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/abstracttexts.png"
        id="image_wvw_mkp_5t"/>
      <i>Abstract Text</i> by clicking on their respective icon at the right edge of the
      toolbar.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The Abstract Text view is not available yet. It will compile the witnesses of a single
      text (e.g. Sinuhe) and deliver a generic structure, e.g. display the concordance of
      paragraphs. The metadata concerning the "abstract text" can be entered here, e.g. the
      bibliography. </p>
    <p>To the right of the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/corpus.png" id="image_vrb_v4r_4r"/>
      icon you can see your main working corpus. At startup "No Corpus" is displayed. To set the
      corpus click on the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png"
        id="image_tsm_5q1_sr"/> Preferences icon, which will forward you to the <xref
        href="ui_berlintextsystem.dita">Corpus Settings</xref>.</p>
