    <p> ADMIN</p>
    <p><b>Creating a corpus</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_j3p_gzv_ns">
        <li>Click the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/corpus-add.png" id="image_rbk_ssv_ps"/>
          "New Corpus" icon. It is located above the <xref href="oberflaeche_corpusnavigator_e9.dita">Corpus Navigator</xref>. </li>
        <li>Choose a name and a prefix (a prefix is a short name under which the corpus will be
          saved in the database.) No special signs, spaces or capital letters are allowed in the
          prefix! Select the checkbox if you want to "Synchronize corpus with central database".
          Other users will be able to see your new corpus only if it is synchronized. Otherwise, it
          will rest in offline mode on your PC. After you have finished, click "OK". Cancel the
          creation with the "Cancel" button. </li>
        <li>Your new corpus will appear in the corpora list, in alphabetical
            order.<p>ADMIN?</p><b>Creating an object</b></li>
        <li>Choose the corpus from the corpora tree where you wish your object to appear. You can
          add an object to a corpus, a text, or even to an other, already existing, object. </li>
        <li>Click "Add Text Corpus Object" in the toolbar. This action will add an object as a
          subentry of the chosen corpus. NOTE: currently the new objects and texts will be saved in
          your main working corpus and not in the selected corpus if they differ. The new objects
          will appear in the selected corpus though. </li>
        <li>Name your object in the <xref href="oberflaeche_maintab.dita"/> of the Passport Editor.
          (The "Name" input field will appear red until it is named.) You can actually start working
          without naming your object and name it later. Before it is named, it will appear in the
          corpora tree as "BTST Object"- its default name.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Define the Type and in case also the Subtype of the object. You can and you also should
            give as much informations as you can by using the tabs of the <xref href="oberflaeche_passporteditor.dita">Passport Editor</xref>.</p>
          <p><b>Creating a text</b></p>
        </li>
        <li>Select a loaction in the Corpus Navigator on the left of the User Interface where you'd
          like to allocate your text. You can add a text to a corpus, an object, or even to an
          already existing text. </li>
        <li>Then click <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/text-add.png" id="image_g1w_bj3_qr"/>
          "Add Text" in the <xref href="oberflaeche_corpusnavigator_e9.dita">Corpus Navigator</xref>
          toolbar. Depending on the object you selected, a "child"-text will be added in the next
          lower hierarchical status in relation to it. In the Navigator it will be named: "BTS Text"
          (in order to see it, you might have to open the parent object).</li>
        <li>Name your text in the <xref href="oberflaeche_maintab.dita#concept_isp_k5f_yr">Main
            Tab</xref> of the Passport Editor. (The "Name" input field will appear red until it is
          named.) You can actually start working without naming your text and name it later. Before
          it is named, it will appear in the corpora tree as "BTS Text"- its default
              name.<p/><p><b>Moving database objects</b></p><p>To move a database object (corpus,
            object, text) from one project or corpus to another, right click the chosen item and
            select "Move among projects" in the appearing context menu. In the opened window the
            current location is displayed. Alter the entries as you wish (upper field for a new
            project and lower field for a new corpus in the project).</p><p><b>Deleting database
              objects</b></p><p>To delete a database object (corpus, object, text) select it and
            then click on <image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png" id="image_ctd_3cw_ns"/>
            "Delete". It will be moved to the bin (<image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/bin.png"
              id="image_std_3cw_ns"/>"Bin" tab in the Corpus Navigator window), where you have the
            opportunity to restore it (right click the object, context menu, "Restore") or to delete
            it permanently. All subordinate elements will be deleted as well. Upon closing or
            restarting the BTS all the item in the Bin will be permanently deleted.</p></li>
