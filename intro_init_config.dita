 <title>Initial configuration of BTS</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>BTS installer currently does  not create BTS entries in the windows "Start" menu or on the
      desktop. You can manually create a file shortcut of the "bts.exe" and drag-&amp;-drop it into
      the start menu and desktop. Double click this icon to start the program. </p>
  <p><b>Configure your BTS</b></p>
  <p>After the initial BTS start, a few settings have to be made. In the Menu bar click on
   "Preferences / Preferences" and expand the "Berlin Text System General" entry by clicking on the
   triangle symbol on the left.</p>
  <p>
   <ol id="ol_jjj_r5j_2s">
    <li><u>Active Corpora</u><p>Choose the "Corpus Settings" option from the expanded menu and add
      the available corpora to the list of the "Active Corpora", selecting all corpora you are going
      to work with. </p></li>
    <li><u>Main working corpus</u><p>The check box "Activate to select main working text corpus" is
            deactivated by default. After selecting this option all new database objects you create
            (ex. texts)  will be saved in the "Main working corpus". For instance, if you mark
            "bbawbriefe" as the main working corpus, all new objects or texts will be physically
            located in it, even if you are currently working with e.g. "bbawtotenlit". So pay
            attention to the location of your new entry and activate this feature only if you feel
            confident that you need it. </p></li>
    <li><u>Sort by sort key</u><p>Expand "Corpus Settings". Click "Corpus Navigator Settings" and
            activate the check box "Corpus Navigator sort by sort key" if it is not activated (It
            should be by default). Press "Apply" to save the setting. Repeat the same for "Lemma
            Navigator Settings" and "Thesaurus Navigator Settings". </p><p>NOTE: By default all
            objects on the same level have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically.
            Defining a "SortKey" in the Passport data of the object will change its position
            relevant to other objects, "0" being on top. </p></li>
    <li>
          <u>Text Editor settings</u><p>Expand the "Text Editor" entry and select the "Sign Text
            Editor". Activating "Show Hieroglyphs", "Show Lemma ID", "Show
            <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Flexion=Inflection<?oxy_custom_end?>"
            and "Show Translation" are recommended as the initial settings. This is, however, not
            required and you can change your preferences any time. </p></li>
    <li><u>Applying the changes</u><p>Press "Apply" after each change in order to save it and close
            the "Preferences" window by clicking "OK".</p><p>To be able to use BTS one final step
            has to be made: the installation of the special keyboard layout which will be used for
            text transliteration. </p></li>
