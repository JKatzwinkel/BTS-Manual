  <title>Administrate user roles and rights</title>
  <body>
    <p>This function is available to the user with administrator privileges only. </p>
    <p>To open the user role administration select "Open User Manager" from the drop-down menu
      "Preferences" of the menu bar. Clicking on this menu entry opens the window "User Management".
      Select the tab: "Administrate User Roles and Rights".</p>
    <p>The user role administration in BTS follows a certain procedure: first roles are assigned to
      a corpus and then users are assigned to existing roles (i.e. Project -> Corpus -> User Role ->
      User Name).</p>
    <p><b>1st Level: Projects</b></p>
    <p>A List of projects is displayed in the field on the left side. Upon clicking on a selected
      project, its data will appear in the field on the right. The data include: Project ID, Project
      Name, Project Prefix, Description, Connection Type, Server URL and DB Path. You can also click
      on the blue link below "Add Database Collection" and in the pop-up window give the name of the
      collection and check boxes "Synchronize Collection" and "Index Collection for Full Text
      Search" if needed. Clicking "OK" will add the collection to the selected project and it will
      appear at the bottom after opening the project tree.</p>
    <p><b>2nd Level: DB Collections</b></p>
    <p>For each collection the data will also be displayed on the right. "DB Collection Name" is
      shown, but cannot be edited. Two check boxes can be selected: "Synchronize with Server" and
      "Index Collection". Below is a drop-down menu "Create New Roles Description" where you can
      choose between admins, editors, researchers, transcribers or guest roles for the users. After
      selecting one option from the drop-down menu, click on the blue link "Add New User Roles
      Description" to add the role.</p>
    <p><b>3rd Level: User Roles</b></p>
    <p>In the tree on the left, the added roles will appear after expanding the collection. On the
      right, "Role Name" and "User Role Definition" (a description of tasks and rights) will appear,
      which cannot be changed. In the two fields below you can assign a user or a group to each
      role. At the bottom there is a blue link "Remove this Role and its members form DB
      collection". Clicking it will remove the selected role from the collection on the left.</p>
    <p><b>4th Level: Users</b></p>
    <p>Expanding (clicking on) a role, users with the assigned roles will be displayed. Clicking on
      individual users will make their first name and surname to appear on the right, in the case
      where an entire group has a specific role, the name of the group will appear. You can remove
      users and groups from specific roles by clicking the blue link on the bottom "Remove Role from
      User" or "Remove Group from Role".</p>
