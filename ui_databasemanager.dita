 <title>Open Database Manager</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The "Database Manager" window in "Preferences" displays all available database collections.
   Each database collection is reflected by a line in the table. The number of documents per
   collection is shown in the column "DB Doc Count". </p>
  <p>The "Database Manager" window automatically opens with each BTS start, if there are any
   problems with the index. To work with the databases and to enable search queries, the databases
   have to be indexed properly. Re-index all databases when they appear either in yellow or red (see
    <xref href="howto_indexing.dita"/>).</p>
