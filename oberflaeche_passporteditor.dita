  <title>Passport Editor</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>The Passport Editor section is located in the bottom part in the middle of the Text Corpus
      view. It contains the metadata of a selected text corpus object. It's divided into different
      subsections which are organized in tabs. These categories vary depending on the view: Text
      Corpus, Lemma, Thesaurus or Abstract Text. The rights to modify object's passport data depend
      on your <xref href="user_roles.dita#topic_yqt_fpq_zs">user role</xref> for the selected
      corpus.</p>
    <p> If you are working on a "child object" and want it to have the same metadata as the "parent
      object", you can click<image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/inherit.png" id="image_fdk_2rt_mr"
      /> "Inherit Passport Data" in the top right corner of the Passport Editor. Note that the
      "parent" data will be copied in the empty fields only. If the fields were filled out, their
      content will remain unchanged. </p>
    <p>NOTE: the inheritance procedure applies to all tabs at once, not only the currently open one. </p>
