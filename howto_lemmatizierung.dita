 <title>3. Lemmatizing and encoding inflections</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>To lemmatize a transliterated text two tabs should be open: "Sign-Text Editor" (default
      location: top center) and "Lemmatizer" (default location: bottom center; note that the title
      of the latter changes as soon as you selected an element in the Navigator tab).  Only
      non-colored (white) tokens in the "Sign Text Editor" are lemmata and can be lemmatized. </p>
    <p>Several elements are displayed in the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmatizer.png"
        id="image_dhr_pqv_nr"/> "Lemmatizer" tab:</p>

      <ol id="ol_xdz_4xy_qt">
        <li>"Activate" button: activates / deactivates other fields</li>
        <li>"Selected Word" displays the transliteration of a lemma selected in the "Sign Text
          Editor". In the example above <i>wbn</i> has already been lemmatized, so the other fields
          are filled out. If you find out that you have made an error in the transliteration, you
          can modify it in the "Selected Word" field and it will be altered in the Sign-Text-Editor
          and the Transliteration tab automatically.</li>
        <li>Lemma provides the lemma number from the word list (WL). Next to it, the selected
          transliteration of a lemma is displayed. To lemmatize a lemma, select the correct
          suggestion from the list in the field below. The default setting in Preferences /
          Preferences / Lemmatizer allows you to activate the function "automatically select the
          first lemma proposal".</li>
        <li>The field "Flexion" shows the code referring to the grammatical form of the inflection
          of the selected word.</li>
        <li>In the field "Translation" you can choose one or several fitting translations from the
          lower field (in the example there is only one option, but there can be more). Make sure to
          have selected the correct language in the drop-down menu on the right. The only choices
          currently available for the Lemmatizer are German and English. Choose several available
          translations by left-clicking and holding CTRL at the same time. If none of the options
          seems fitting to you, you can enter your own translation as well.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>If you cannot find a lemma, click the magnifying glass <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/search.png" id="image_zyn_pqp_nt"/> and search for it in the
      lemma list by entering the WCN (word corpus number) or the name of the lemma. You can also
      reduce the search results by using the filters "Search for IDs" or "Search for Names only".
      Additionally, you can automatically add wild cards / quotation marks by clicking the provided
      buttons in the Search pop-up. More on search function see the corresponding <xref
        href="searching.dita">section</xref>. If the lemma you need does not exist please contact
      the BTS Project. </p>
    <p>To confirm click on <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_pd2_53w_nr"
      /> "Confirm current lemma editing and continue to next lemma" or on ">" button. ">|" brings
      you to the end of the line and >|| to the end of the text.</p>
    <p>To delete  lemmatization click on <image
        href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/lemmatizer-delete.png" id="image_l33_m2g_ms"/>
      "Remove lemma information" in the Lemmatizer toolbar.</p>
