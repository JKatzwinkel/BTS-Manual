 <title>3. Lemmatizing and encoding inflections</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>To lemmatize a transliterated text two tabs should be open: <xref
        href="oberflaeche_texteditor_e10.dita">Sign Text Editor</xref> (default location: top
      center) and <xref href="oberflaeche_lemmatizer.dita">Lemmatizer</xref> (default location:
      bottom center; note that the title of the latter changes as soon as you have selected an
      element in the Navigator tab). Only non-grey tokens in the "Sign Text Editor" are lemmata and
      can be lemmatized. </p>
    <p>Several elements are displayed in the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmatizer.png"
        id="image_dhr_pqv_nr"/> "Lemmatizer" tab:</p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Lemmatizer_marked.png"
        id="image_iht_myx_st"/></p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_xdz_4xy_qt">
        <li>"Activate" button: activates / deactivates the Lemmatizer (grey = deactivated; blue =
          activated).</li>
        <li>"Selected Word" displays the transliteration of a lemma selected in the "Sign Text
          Editor". In the example above <i>wbn</i> has already been lemmatized, so the other fields
          are filled out. If you find out that you have made an error in the transliteration, you
          can modify it in the "Selected Word" field and it will be altered in the Sign-Text-Editor
          and the Transliteration tab automatically.</li>
        <li>Lemma provides the lemma number (WCN) from the word list (WL). Next to it, the selected
          transliteration of a lemma is displayed. To lemmatize a lemma, select the correct
          suggestion from the list in the field below. The default setting in Preferences /
          Preferences / Lemmatizer allows you to activate the function "automatically select the
          first lemma proposal".<p>NOTE: Be careful with this function, because you might
            unindentedly select wrong a lemma or lemmatize without intention.</p></li>
        <li>The field "Flexion" shows the code referring to the grammatical form of the inflection
          of the selected word (see <xref href="grammar_flexioCodes.dita">Inflection codes</xref>).</li>
        <li>In the field "Translation" you can choose one or several fitting translations from the
          lower field (in the example there is only one option, but there can be more). Make sure to
          have selected the correct language in the drop-down menu on the right. The only choices
          currently available for the Lemmatizer are German and English. Choose several available
          translations by left-clicking and holding CTRL at the same time. If none of the options
          seems fitting to you, you can enter your own translation as well.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>If you cannot find a lemma, click the magnifying glass <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/search.png" id="image_zyn_pqp_nt"/> and search for it in the
      lemma list by entering the WCN (i.e. the ID of the lemma) or the transliteration or the
      translation of the lemma. You can also reduce the search results by using the filters "Search
      for IDs" or "Search for Names only". </p>
    <p>To filter for a specific WCN you have to activate the filter "Search for ID". If you do not,
      you will not get a result, because the full text search does not search the field "ID".
      (However, in case of lemmata that have been imported from the previous BTS version you will
      get a full text search result, because there the WCN appears as an external ID. This does not
      apply to lemmata created in this BTS version.)</p>
    <p>If you use the filter "Search for Names only", BTS does not execute a full text search, but a
      search only on the name of the database objects. "Names" does not mean "Personal Names", but
      it is the standard designation, i.e. the transliteration of the lemma (dictionary form). This
      box is activated by default, because otherwise BTS will make a full text search in the
      Lemmalist. Additionally, you can automatically add wild cards / quotation marks by clicking
      the provided buttons in the Search pop-up. More on search function see the corresponding <xref
        href="searching.dita">section</xref>. If the lemma you need does not exist please contact
      the BTS Project. </p>
    <p>To confirm click on <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_pd2_53w_nr"
      /> "Confirm current lemma editing and continue to next lemma" or on ">" button. The button
      ">|" brings you to the end of the line and >|| to the end of the text.</p>
    <p>To delete  lemmatization click on <image
        href="Images/Icons_updated/full/icon16/lemmatizer-delete.png" id="image_l33_m2g_ms"/>
      "Remove lemma information" in the Lemmatizer toolbar.</p>
    <p>Experience has learned that it is better to lemmatize a text first and only afterwards fill
      out the field "Flexion".</p>
    <p>You should always click the "Activate" button after you finished the lemmatization to avoid
      unintended lemmatizations.</p>
