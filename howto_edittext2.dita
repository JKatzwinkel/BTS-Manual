  <title>Editing a text</title>
  <body>
    <p>The process of editing a text begins with entering the transliteration in the Text Editor
      Transliteration field. However, in order to enter a transliteration, you first need to <xref
        href="intro_install_keyboard.dita">install and configure the keyboard</xref> provided by the
      BBAW. </p>
    <p>One of the most important steps in the text editing process is lemmatizing each word of your
      transliterated text. Lemmatization is a lexical annotation of each word regardless of its
      inflected forms. In a semi automatic process each word is linked with a lemma entry in the
      integrated lemma list and takes over simultaneously all lexical properties of the lemma entry
      like (POS-label, base translation(s), bibliographical references).</p>
    <p>Furthermore the editing process involves entering a translation in either German, English,
      French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, or Russian, entering hieroglyphic writings of each text word
      and assigning <xref href="grammar_inflection.dita#concept_zjw_dsx_nt">inflection codes</xref>
      to the lemma. You are enabled to mark rubra and to add comments to the transliteration
      whenever you wish. The following order of editing is not compulsory. It is only supposed to
      help you with particular functions of the BTS. It is up to you to decide the order of the text
      editing.</p>
    <p>NOTE: You can only enter translation, lemmatization, annotations, and hieroglyphs after you
      have typed the transliteration.</p>
