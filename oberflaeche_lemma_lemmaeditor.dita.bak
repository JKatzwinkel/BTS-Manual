 <title>Lemma Editor</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The "Lemma Editor" is located in the upper centre of the User Interface while Lemma View is
   active. It contains three sections:</p>
  <p><u>Transliteration</u></p>
  <p>The lemma transliteration tab is identical to the similar section in the <xref
    href="oberflaeche_texteditor_e10.dita"/>. Transliterate the lemma in this field within the "§"
   signs. If the transliteration is not enclosed in "§" (like in the case of the text
   transliteration), it will not be valid. Each lemma has to be enclosed in it (left and right of
   the written word, without "space"). </p>
  <p><i>Compound-word-lemmata:</i> If you want to enter a lemma that consists of multiple words
   (e.g. as in m-Xnw), use "-" between each element. If you want to split them into multiple
   elements (but have it as one entry) then just use "space" between each word. Do not enclose each
   word individually with "§". </p>
  <p><i>Example:</i></p>
  <p>"m-Xnw": Typing "§m-Xnw§" marks one element while "§m Xnw§" marks two elements: "m" and
   "Xnw".</p>
  <p>Wrong: "§m§ §Xnw§".</p>
  <p><u>Sign-Text</u></p>
  <p>In the "Sign-Text" window the entered lemma appears as a single element (or elements, if it is
   sub-divided into more than one entry). This means that you can sub-lemmatize every element of a
   lemma-entry, if you have splitted the element as explained above.</p>
  <p><u>Translation</u></p>
  <p>Enter the translation for the complete lemma into this field. Select the language of your
   choice by leftclicking the dropdown menu marked by <image
    href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_jwn_h5c_qr"/>.</p>
