 <title>1. Transliteration</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>To enter or edit the transliteration of your texts, click in the "Transliteration" tab of the
        <xref href="oberflaeche_texteditor_e10.dita">Text Editor</xref> in the upper centre of the
      Text Corpus view.</p>
  <p/>
    <p><b>Segmentation of a text</b></p>
    <p>The text has to be sequenced in sentences according to the Egyptian syntax. Start and end
      each sentence with the sentence marker "§". There is no "space" between "§" and the adjacent
      word.</p>
    <p>Rules for the segmentation of sentences:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_yp5_2sz_2x">
        <li>Main and subclauses belong together as one sentence.</li>
        <li>The emphatic construction is one sentence (e.g. <i>pr.n =j m pr =j hꜣ.n =j m spꜣ.t =j
            jrj.n =j mꜣꜥ.z tp tꜣ</i>).</li>
        <li>Protasis and Apodosis of a conditional clause are one sentence (e.g. <i>jr ḏd=f nj ꜥnḫ=f
            pw</i>).</li>
        <li>Relative clauses belong to the superordinated clause.</li>
        <li>Subjuctive clauses and clauses introduced by n.tj, wn.t, or jw.tj belong to the
          superordinated clause.</li>
        <li>Prepositional subclauses belong to the superordinated clause (e.g. <i>ḫr m-ḫt hrw.w 3
            swꜣw ḥr nn</i> + main clauce + <i>r rdj.t</i> ...).</li>
        <li>Adverbal clauses belong to the superordinated clause, if the subordination is
          clear.</li>
        <li>Continuative forms (e.g. <i>mtw=</i>) are segmented in seperate sentences.</li>
        <li>Direct speech forms a seperate sentence.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Logical phrases and formulas are treated as sentences:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_szy_lrz_2x">
        <li>Headings, labels, and notes are sentences.</li>
        <li>Tables are segmented according to headings, lines, and columns.</li>
        <li>Offering formulas and (short) prayers are treated as one sentence.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: Sentence boundaries can always be modified later, but the translation of the modified
      sentences will be lost.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Transliteration</b> follows the BTS Conventions (see: <xref
        href="grammar_transliteration_system.dita"/>).</p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Text-critical signs and brackets</b> follow BTE Conventions (see: <xref
        href="grammar_brackets.dita"/>).</p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Adding Extra-textual Information</b></p>
    <p><b>Line Count</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ugx_ryw_ns">
        <li>Line counts according to the physical object are introduced by #lc: and end with
            <b>#</b>. The numbers are written in square brackets. E.g.: Line 1 = #lc: [1]#. If the
          line break in the original text occurs within the borders of a word, the line count is to
          be placed after the respective word.</li>
        <li>For line count according to synoptic editions used to align multiple versions of a text,
          as a kind of milestone use #para: ...#. E.g.: CT VI 106a = #para: CT VI 106a#.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: It is not allowed to use colon between "#" more than once.</p>
   <p>NOTE: It is not allowed to use colon directly after or directly before "#".</p>
    <p>NOTE: The line count provided by BTS at the left egde of the Text Editor is only temporary.
      It changes at each line break.</p>
    <p/>
   <p><b>Descriptive Information</b></p>
    <p>Descriptive information, e.g. for representations the inscriptions are referring to, are
      placed betwenn "#". </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_jly_jzz_2x">
        <li>For the description of representations to which text refers, use "#descr: #", e.g.
          #descr: Amun, thronend#</li>
        <li>Other descriptions without reference can be added freely between two "#", e.g. #3Q sind
          leer gelassen#.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Destructions</b> (see: <xref href="grammar_destructions.dita"/>)</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>A destruction is indicated by two hyphens <b>--...--</b>. E.g.: --rest of line
          destroyed--, --3Q-- (destruction of 3 scriptorial squares).<p>NOTE: It is not allowed to
            use the hyphen within the destruction marker.</p></li>
        <li>If the number of words missing can precisely be determined (e.g. if the words are
          completely lost, but with the determinatives preserved), use underscores in brackets
          "[___]". E.g.: "[___] [___]" for 2 missing words.</li>
        <li>All other descriptive information is to be put between "#": E.g.: #in front of the first
          person looking left#; #3Q are left empty#.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Illegible parts and spaces intentionally left blank</b></p>
    <ul id="ul_uth_rc1_fx">
      <li>
        <p>If a word or a sequence of words is illegible or only partly legible, use underscores,
          e.g. "_b_"; "n_[_],t"; "[_]_[_]"; [___].pl etc.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul id="ul_zhm_rc1_fx">
      <li>
        <p>Empty cartouches are transliterated with 3 underscores: "___" and are lemmatized with WCN
          550225.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul id="ul_jdr_rc1_fx">
      <li>
        <p>Blank parts of a text that were intended for a later addition of a personal name and
          titles (e.g. on a coffin), are transliterated as decriptive information: "#3Q
          unbeschriftet#", "#5Q leer für Titel und Namen des Verstorbenen#" etc.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Ambiguities</b></p>
    <p>Ambiguities have to be noted,</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_pls_1vy_2x">
        <li>if a group of hieroglyphs can be transliterated and interpreted in different ways,</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_avw_1vy_2x">
        <li>if a group of hieroglyphs can be lemmatized differently,</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_pxb_bvy_2x">
        <li>if a group of hieroglyphs can be encoded with different inflection codes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Ambiguities are entered as: "%case 1: ...| case 2: ...| case 3: ...%". You can input as many
      cases as you need. Be careful not to type a space in front of the vertical stroke. </p>
    <p>Example: %case 1: rd.du| case 2: war,t.du%"</p>
    <p>NOTE: Sentence separators, extra-textual information and destruction markers, e.g. "§", line
      counts (#lc: ...#) and --2Q--, are not allowed within ambiguities.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>The most important rules are the following</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_wh1_bxw_ns">
        <li>The dual and plural endings are transcribed with ".w" or ".wj/.tj" when written
          phonetically. When marked graphically, they are transcribed with ".pl" or ".du". When the
          plural and dual endings are written both phonetically and graphically they are transcribed
          with both options: ".w.pl" or ".wj/.tj.du".</li>
        <li>It is not allowed to leave out an ending ("nb."), to write two full stops ("nb.."), to
          close brackets before you open them ("n]b[") or to interlace different kinds of brackets
          wrongly ("{n[b}]").</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Using Templates</b></p>
    <p>It is possible to use templates in order to speed up the transliteration process. Note that
      you can create your own templates (<xref
        href="oberflaeche_preferences2.dita#concept_trz_tw2_yr">Preferences</xref>). You can access
      the templates by right-clicking in Text Editor and choosing "Content Assist" or by pressing
      "CRTL+Spacebar". Depending on the position of the cursor (within a sentence / word or outside
      the sentence marked by §§) you will get a different set of templates to choose from. This can
      be influenced by changing the "Context" of your templates (see <xref
        href="oberflaeche_preferences2.dita#concept_trz_tw2_yr">Preferences</xref>).</p>
    <p><b>Copy&amp;Paste functions</b></p>
    <p>BTS supports copy&amp;paste within the same text as well as between diffrent texts.</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_jgl_mby_2x">
        <li>It is possible to enter the complete transliteration of a text at once out of an
          external source (e.g. a MS Word document) by copy&amp;paste, if one follows all the rules
          of BTS grammar. The transliteration used in MS Word should be the unicodefont
          BBAW-Libertine.</li>
        <li>You can copy your transliteration, parts of it or extra-textual information and paste it
          anywhere in the same or another text. By doing this, only the transliteration will be
          copied, even if the tokens are lemmatized.</li>
        <li>If you want to copy&amp;paste your transliteration as lemmazied tokens, use the feature
          "Copy with Lemmata" and "Paste with Lemmata". This feature copies and pastes the
          transliteration including inflection code, hieroglyphs, and translation. It does not copy
          any annotation, comment, or rubrum.<p>
            <ul id="ul_k51_jcy_2x">
              <li>This feature does not work for single words and phrases. You can only copy
                complete sentences. Mark the sentence or the set of sentences you would like to
                copy. Click on it (right-click) and select "Copy with Lemmata".</li>
              <li>Proceed to the text where you want to insert the sentence(s). Righ-click the exact
                position and select "Paste with Lemmata". To insert a sentence after an existing
                sentence, plase the cursor behind the "§" sign.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>NOTE: You are not allowed to use "Paste with Lemmata" in an empty text. Frist you need
          to enter some dummy text and press "Load Text Lemmata". After pasting yout text you can
          delete dummy.<p>NOTE: The sentence you want to copy as well as the sentence in, before, or
            after which you want to insert the copied sentence(s) is activated. Activation is shown
            by the sign <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_szd_1fs_2x"/>
            diretly to the left of the sentence (compare note on <xref
              href="howto_translation.dita">translation</xref> below).</p></li>
