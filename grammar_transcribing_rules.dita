 <title>Rules for transliterating a text</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>A proper transliteration should represent all phonetical and morphological information that can
   be received from a text. A transliteration should also represent damages of the text and mistakes
   or corrections of the text by the ancient scribes. We recommend transliterating the written form
   of any word, as long as there is no evidence that it has undergone considerable changes in its
   phonology.</p>
  <p/>
  <p>The following structural elements should be reflected by a transliteration: every phonological
   or morphological element which is a part of a written word. Graphical elements without
   phonological or morphological function should not to be reflected (e.g. determinatives). </p>
