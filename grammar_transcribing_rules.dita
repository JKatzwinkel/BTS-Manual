 <title>Rules for transcribing a text</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>A proper transcription should represent all phonetical and morphological information that can
   be received from a text. A transcription should also represent destructions and mistakes. We
   recommend the transcription to be coherent with generally used transcriptions. Please avoid using
   unusual solutions. We also recommend transcribing the traditional form of any word, as long as
   there is no evidence that it has undergone considerable changes in its phonology.</p>
  <p/>
  <p>The following structural elements shall be reflected by a transcription: every phonological or
   morphological element which is a part of a written word. Graphical elements without phonological
   or morphological function should not to be reflected (e.g. determinatives). </p>
