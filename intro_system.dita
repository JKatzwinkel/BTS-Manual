 <conbody>
  <p><b>Supported Operation Systems: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit </b> This is Basti10. And this is Max 11.
   Joa7. Simon5. Simon6.</p>
  <p>BTS has been tested on Windows 7 SP1 64-bit and Windows 8.1 64-bit. We do not guarantee the
   full functionality on other Windows OS (XP, Windows 10 or Windows Server). </p>
  <p><b>Required RAM: 4 GB</b></p>
  <p>Your local BTS installation will constantly communicate with the server, updating the data. BTS
   will synchronize and download all available database files, which are now about 2 GB large.
   Therefore check your internet-connection and make sure it's working. Otherwise BTS will be in
   offline-mode and will not be able to synchronize with the server.</p>
  <p><b>Attention Mac and Linux users</b></p>
  <p>BTS does not support Mac or Linux OS. As a "workaround" we suggest to use a virtual machine
   with Windows such as WINE and run BTS via this feature. Popular VM solutions for Mac include VM
   Ware Fusion and Parallels (both commercial) and Virtual Box (free of charge) . In that case you
   will still need Windows license to install Windows on your VM. </p>
  <p><b>Required Java Version: Java V 7</b></p>
  <p>BTS is a Java application, which requires JAVA Runtime Environment from Version 7 up. To check
   if Java is installed on your PC, go to https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp. If the
   required version is not installed, the update will be automatically offered. </p>
  <p><b>Port sharing</b>
  </p>
  <p>The port number used by the Couch DB to communicate with the server should be shared in the
   firewall of your PC. For the port number see "Install BTS / Database Installation Setting". </p>
