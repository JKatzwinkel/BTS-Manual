 <title>Text Editor</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Text Editor tab is located in the upper part in the middle of the Text Corpus view. The
   text input field is empty as long as no text from the Corpus Navigator is selected. Upon
   selecting a text you will be able to transliterate it and enter hieroglyphs. This chapter
   provides a general description of the tab. For a step-by-step instruction of how to enter a new
   text please refer to the relevant <xref href="howto_edittext2.dita#topic_k3c_35y_qt"
    >chapter</xref> in the User Guide section of this manual. </p>
  <p>The Text Editor section contains two input fields. The upper one displays either the
   "Transliteration", the "Sign Text Editor" or the "JSesh View" - depending on the tab selected.
   The lower input field displays translation of the sentence, selected with the cursor in the upper
   window. </p>

  <p><b>Transliteration</b></p>
  <p>Here you can enter or modify the transliteration of the text which you previously selected in
   the corpora tree. Beware of the <xref href="howto_grammar_rules_e5.dita#topic_f5w_3z5_kr">BTS
    Grammar Rules</xref>, otherwise the auto-checker system will trigger an error, marked by a red
   square and underlined red. </p>
  <p><b>Sign Text Editor </b></p>
  <p>The "Sign-Text-Editor" provides the token-based presentation of the text. Initially only the
   transliteration is displayed there - each word / lemma in a separate box. The Lemma ID, the
   inflection code, the Lemma Translation and hieroglyphs of each token can be made visible via menu
   entry  "Preferences / Preferences / Berlin Text System General / Text Editor / Sign Text Editor". </p>
  <p>The hieroglyphic input is done in the <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/hieroglyphetw.png"
    id="image_ok5_nlw_nr"/> Hieroglyph Type Writer tab below. The hieroglyphic values, entered
   there, are automatically applied to the selected lemmata in the "Sign-Text-Editor" sub-tab.
   Additionally to the transcription and hieroglyphs, a lemma number and inflection code will be
   displayed in each word box after a successful lemmatization.</p>
  <p><b>JSesh View</b></p>
  <p>Displays a cohesive hieroglyphic text. "dot" marks the end of the sentence (signified in
   "Transliteration" and "Sign Text Editor" tabs with "ยง" sign). </p>
  <p>There are several buttons above the "Text-Editor" window: </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-load.png" id="image_sws_dns_mr"/>
   <u>Load Text Lemmata </u></p>
  <p>Loads word and sentence borders of your texts in order to be able to add a translation and to
   lemmatize the words and add the hieroglyphs in the next steps. Click this button after
   transliteration has been finished. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chcecklemmata.png" id="image_glp_wld_vt"/><u>Check Text
    Lemmata, Flexcodes...</u>
  </p>
  <p>Checks the completeness of text lemmatization, translation and hieroglyphic transcription. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation-add.png" id="image_ixh_g4s_mr"/>
   <u>Add Annotation </u></p>
  <p>Adds an <xref href="howto_annotationen.dita">Annotation</xref> to the selected part of your
   text. It will be underlined with a gray dotted line. </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/rubrum-add.png" id="image_gwm_dqs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Rubrum </u></p>
  <p>The active token is marked red in the text as rubrum.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext-add.png" id="image_zxr_pqs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Subtext/Glosses</u></p>
  <p>Adds a subtext or a gloss respectively as a "child" of your text. You can edit it
   separately.</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png" id="image_d5g_krs_mr"/>
   <u>Add Comment </u></p>
  <p>Adds a comment to the selected part. It will be underlined yellow.</p>
  <p>You can use these functions also via the drop-down menu that appears when you click on the arrow
   on the right. </p>
  <p>Additionally, for Annotations, Rubra and Comments, a small, rectangular bar will appear on the
   right side of the Text-Editor with the corresponding colour. Clicking on the bar will bring you
   to the marked segment of the text. </p>
  <p><b>Sentence translation</b></p>
  <p>At the bottom of the Text Editor tab there is a text-input field where you can enter a
   translation of every sentence. With the existing transliteration it is deactivated unless a lemma
   has been selected in the "Text editor" or until you click somewhere into the sentence. With the
   new transliteration it is greyed out until you press "Load Text Lemmata" - after this the
   text-input field will be activated. Note that you have to switch the keyboard layout from "AAeW"
   to standard to enter the translation.</p>
  <p>The <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_plt_3yt_mr"/> "Languages" icon
   offers a drop-down menu with a number of languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Russian) to
   choose from. Choose the language of your translation.</p>
