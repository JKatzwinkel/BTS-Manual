 <title>2. Translation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can type the translation of individual sentences in the text input field "Sentence
            translation". This window will remain deactivated (greyed out) during transliteration,
            until you press the button "Load Text Lemmata" or until you switch to the "Sign Text
            Editor" and back.</p>
  <p>Make sure to have selected the right language in the dropdown menu on the right. (<image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_krw_wmv_nr"/> : de, en, fr, es,
            ru). In the standard view only one line will be visible. Extend the text editor window
            and scroll up and down if the sentence contains more than one line. The complete
            translation of the text will appear on the right of your BTS screen in the "Text
            translation" tab. Clicking on a sentence here will highlighten it and the same sentence
            will be underlined in the "Transliteration" tab.</p>
