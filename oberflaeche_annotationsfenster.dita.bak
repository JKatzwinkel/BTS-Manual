  <p><u>The "Annotations" tab </u> can contain the following elements: </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation.png" id="image_p3k_pz3_sr"/> "Annotation"</p>

  <p>Click one of them in order to display their content. The related content will be marked in the
   text with different colours: bright red for Rubra; yellow for comments; gray for Annotations and
   blue for Glosses. Clicking an annotation will also cause the underlining of the related fragment
   in the text to appear thicker. Additionally, for Annotations, Rubra and Comments, a small bar
   will appear on the right side of the Text-Editor with the corresponding colour. Clicking on the
   bar will bring you to the marked fragment of the text. </p>
  <p>Each annotation, rubrum, comment and gloss contains a toolbar with the following buttons:</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-add.png" id="image_ult_dv3_sr"/> "Add Current Text
   Selection as Reference" </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-edit.png" id="image_zwn_fv3_sr"/> "Update Current
   Reference"</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-delete.png" id="image_zjx_hv3_sr"/> "Remove Current
   Reference" </p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/edit.png" id="image_jjk_l5t_mr"/> "Edit Comment" or "Edit
   Annotation". This opens a window with different content for annotation, rubrum and comment. It is
   not available for <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext.png" id="image_mb4_q1j_sr"/>
   "Glosse".</p>

   subtexts/glosses to other parts of the text. </p>

   Each annotation will have its own ID and its relation to the chosen text will be shown in the
   "Relations" tab. </p>

   or edit a title for your comment in the upper input field and the content of your comment in the

   the currently selected element.</p>

  <p><u>"Text translation" tab</u></p>
  <p>The "Text translation" tab shows a continuous, sentence by sentence translation and allows for
   a continuous proof reading. The languages <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png"
    id="image_w1q_vm3_ns"/> dropdown menu allows to select a translation in the relevant languages.
   Sentences which have not been translated yet are marked as "## no trans: de ##ยง", "## no trans:
   en ##ยง" etc. A leftclick on a sentence activates the same sentence in the "Sign text editor", in
   the "Transliteration" editor as well as in the "Sentence translation" window. A typo or another
   problem observed in the continuous translation can be altered in the "Sentence translation"
   window.</p>
