 <title>Database Manager</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>"Database manager" window opens every time you start BTS. It can also be started through
   "Preferences / Open Database Manager". </p>
  <p><b><u>Open Database Manager</u></b></p>
  <p>Window "Database manager" displays all available database collections. Each database collection
   is reflected by a line in the table. The number of documents per collection is shown in the
   column "DB Doc Count".  </p>
  <p><b><u>Indexing</u></b></p>
  <p>Indexing is a process, which speeds up the search in the database. Indexing allows the query to
   be done not in the database documents themselves, but in their "indexes".  The status of a
   corpus' indexing process is indicated by the background colour of its line in the "Database
   Manager". Each line can have one of four background colours. Green means that everything is
   properly indexed. Yellow indicates that this corpus is currently being indexed, while red stands
   for a problem that ocurred. The column "Index Doc Count" shows the number of the already indexed
   documents in this corpus. Additionally, the Status of the corpus will be diplayed in the "Status"
   column (OK- green, ERROR- red or INDEXING...- yellow). The "% indexed" column shows the
   precentage of the indexing process.</p>
  <p><b><u>Re-Indexing</u></b></p>
  <p>Reindexing has three options: </p>
  <p>- Re-index all</p>
  <p>- Re-index all non-OK </p>
  <p>- Reindex individual DB collection.  </p>
  <p/>
  <p>To reindex individual collections, select it with the mouse click, scroll to the right and
   click on "Reindex". </p>
  <p><b><u>Close</u></b></p>
  <p>Leave the "Database Manager" window by clicking the "Close" button in the lower right corner. </p>
