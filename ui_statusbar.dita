      of this icon, a status message is displayed, e.g. the position of your cursor in a selected
      text (line number, column (= position in line), unicode) or the information that database
      objects are suppressed because you do not have the specific rights to see them. Clicking on
      the icon will display a window with the last 25 status messages. </p>
