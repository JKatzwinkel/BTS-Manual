 <conbody>
  <p>The annotations and text translation window is placed on the right side of the default BTS user
   interface in each view. You can maximize and minimize the window with <image
    href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/maximize.png" id="image_w3j_gn3_ns"/> and <image
    href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/minimize.png" id="image_qkj_gn3_ns"/> buttons.</p>
  <p>For each entry either an "Annotation" <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/annotation.png"
    id="image_p3k_pz3_sr"/> or a "Comment" <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment.png"
    id="image_qrx_zz3_sr"/> can be entered. The relevant buttons are placed in the toolbar of the
   Lemma Navigator (at the left side of the workspace). Each annotation or comment offers
   additionally the following functions:</p>
  <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/chain-add.png" id="image_ult_dv3_sr"/>
