    <p>Every Text is a standalone Element and is at least a part (child) of a text-corpus. It can
      relate to another corpus or to an object directly by being attached to it or indirectly by
      standing in a certain relation (part of etc...) to it. Therefore, each text is potentially
      independent of other texts and objects as a standalone element. The designation of the
      relationship is conducted by grouping and assigning of the text to a corpus or an object.</p>
