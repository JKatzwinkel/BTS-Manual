 <title>Inversions</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><i>When the inverted words form a single lemma</i> the sign-sequence is to be entered as it
      appears in the script. </p>
  <p><i>When the inverted words do not form a single lemma</i> each word is to be encoded with the
      signs that belong to it. The inverted sign-sequence cannot be reproduced. </p>
  <p><i>When the inversion occurs while the word boundaries are broken</i> , e.g. <image
        href="Images/Hypszer/Handbuch-Screenschots/Hieros.jpg" id="image_hdj_gzt_mr"/> ,the signs
      have to be assigned to words they belong to (in this case V30+G7 and I9 separately). The
      inverted sign-sequence cannot be reproduced/depicted with the hieroglyphs but the program
      offers an option to mark such inversions.</p>
    <p><b>Select Single Glyphs</b></p>
  <p>This function is available for the last type of inversions. To mark the correct position of G7
      determinative, select it using buttons |&lt; &lt; > >| . The selected sign will be marked red.
      After that set the "Order in Sentence" to the position where the sign occurs in the
      manuscript. Then do the same with the I9 sign. In the example below G7 and I9 have to switch
      to positions 7 and 6 accordingly.  </p>
