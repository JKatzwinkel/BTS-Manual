  <title>5. Entering Hieroglyphs</title>
  <body>
    <p>To edit the hieroglyphs of your text, you need to switch to the Sign Text Editor and then
      open the Hieroglyph Type Writer (HTW). HTW is based on JSesh application, created by Serge
      Rosmorduc.</p>

        <li>Click on a transliterated lemma in the Sign Text Editor tab, the word will be
          highlighted yellow. In the Hieroglyph Type Writer tab click into the "Type here" text
          field - this is where the hieroglyph input takes place. There are two different ways to
          enter the hieroglyphs. The first one is to enter the numbers of the Gardiner sign list
          (e.g. F18). The second is to enter the transliteration according to the Manuel de Codage
          rules.</li>
        <li>When entering the first letters of a transliteration of a lemma, the programme will
          present you a list of hieroglyphs to choose from. Every hieroglyph has a number in red
          appearing next to it. To select a sign which does not appear on the first position on the
          list, press CTRL button on your keyboard and a number corresponding to the red number of
          the chosen sign. E.g. in the following screenshot there are four options presented for the
          input of the letter 'n'. If you would like to select the N35B-sign you would have to press
              CTRL+3.<p><image

              id="image_pnd_pfy_st"/></p>Afterwards, a Gardiner number will appear in the "type
          here" field and you will be able to continue hieroglyph input normally.<p><image

              id="image_vp5_qfy_st"/></p>Separate the hieroglyphs of a word either only by "-"
          between the hieroglyphs (then all signs will be written one behind the other) or group
          them according to the "Manuel de Codage" rules with "-", "*" and ":". For more details see
          the section <xref href="howto_grouping.dita#concept_u45_b1d_cs">Grouping
            Hieroglyphs</xref>.<p><u>NOTE</u>: Do not use the space bar to separate the signs.
          </p></li>
        <li>In order to confirm the input of the signs and end the work on one word, either press
          ENTER on your keyboard, or click the icon of the scribal tool in HTW. You can also simply
          click on another word in the Text Editor if the word on which you would like to work is
          not the next one. Additionally, you can navigate between the words with the following
          icons in the HTW: ||&lt; and >|| will bring you to the first and last word of the document
          respectively.|&lt; and >| will bring you to the word at the beginning and end of the line
          respectively (the line as it appears in the Sign Text Editor, not the line of the given
          text), &lt; and > will bring you to the previous and next word respectively. Furthermore,
          a ToolTip will be displayed on mouseover for each icon.</li>
        <li>After the input and confirmation of the signs, upon returning to a transcribed word,
          Gardiner numbers of the signs will be shown in the "type here" field, even if the signs
          were initially entered as "Manuel de Codage" transliteration. In order to see the number
          sequence, select an already-processed word.<p><image

              id="image_tdt_vfy_st"/></p></li>
        <li>If you need to correct an already confirmed word, you can return to it by clicking on it
          in the Sign-Text-Editor or by using the previously described navigation icons and then
          making alterations in the "Type here" input field. If you need to delete the already
          entered hieroglyphs, you can simply use BACKSPACE or DELETE button on your keyboard and
          confirm by pressing ENTER. You can also click on the <image

          Hieroglyph Data" in the toolbar in the upper right corner, after clicking the chosen
          word.</li>
