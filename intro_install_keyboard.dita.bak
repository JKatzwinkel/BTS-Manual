      programm package right mouse-click on "BBAWLibertine_ah.ttf" and select "install". Check is

      <ul id="ul_erd_55p_ps">
        <li><u>Install the AAeW Keyboard</u></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now the "AAeW Keyboard" can be installed in the Keyman Desktop. This keyboard layout has all
      necessary characters, including brackets, verse points and cartouches. </p>
    <p>In the bottom task bar click on "Tavultesoft Keyman Desktop" icon and select "Configuration".
      Click on "Install keyboard..." and select file "aaew.kmx" available in your program package.

      section for the position of the characters. </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_sqn_55p_ps">
        <li><u>AAeW Keyboard characters</u>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The lower left characters are entered by simply pressing the key. </p>
    <p>The upper characters are entered by pressing <b>Shift + Key</b>
    </p>
    <p>The lower right characters are entered by pressing <b>Ctrl + Alt + Key</b>. Example: "Ctrl" +
      "Alt" + "8" = "["</p>
    <p>Characters such as "ẖ" are generated by "deadkeys". You type these signs in by combining the
      elements "-" and "h" respectively. For example to write "ẖ" press the deadkey (always first)
      for "-" ( "Shift" + "-") and then "h".</p>
