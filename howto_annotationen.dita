 <title>4. Annotations, Rubra, Glosses and Comments</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>BTS text editing tools include an annotation, a rubrum, a gloss or a comment, which can be
      applied to a word or a sequence of words, a sentence or several sentences.   </p>
    <p><b>What is the difference between an annotation, a subtext, a rubrum or a comment?</b></p>
    <p><i>Annotation</i> is intended to provide the extra-textual information for parts of the text,
      which may include bibliographical references via Thesaurus. Annotations can thus include
      meta-data. Annotations are not limited to one fragment, they can be connected with more than
      one section of a text. You can use annotation, for example, to divide your text into chapters
      (e.g. first part being a biography and the next an offering scene), as the titles of
      particular sections cannot be inserted in the transliteration in the Text Editor. </p>
    <p><i>Subtext</i> is use it to mark sections of a text in a case when the sequence of the
      chapters is not clear.</p>
    <p><i>Rubrum</i> is used to mark rubrum in the text.</p>
    <p><i>Comment</i> is an information to a text which can discuss problems of a phrase or a word
      but cannot be related to other sections (unlike annotations, comments cannot have meta-data
      such as e.g. bibliographical information). </p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>To edit a text, use buttons above the "Text Editor" tab</b></p>
    <p>Mark the sequence you want to annotate: for only one word you just place the cursor within
      the word;  if the word comprises a single character only, place the cursor directly behind the
      character). You can create more than one annotation for the same token, and vice versa, the
      same annotation can be created for different tokens. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If buttons are deactivated, click somewhere outside of your text and then again in it. </p>

      <u>Add Annotation</u>
    </p>
    <p>Adds an <xref href="howto_annotationen.dita">Annotation</xref> to the selected part of your
      text. A grey bar appears in the "Annotation" tab to the right, with a  thin like marking which
      part of the text the annotation refers to. It is possible to enter Passport Data, as you may
      want to provide meta-data (extra-textual information). </p>

      <u>Add Rubrum</u>
    </p>
    <p>Converts the selected part of the text into a rubrum, which is indicated by red color of the
      text and a grey bar on the right. </p>
    <p>NOTE: Currently you cannot delete rubra via the "Undo" button.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/subtext-add.png" id="image_zxr_pqs_mr"/>
      <u>Add Subtext/Gloss</u>
    </p>
    <p>Can be used as either a subtext or a gloss . Clicking on a button will add a "child"-element
      of your text in the corpora tree. It can be edited like a regular text. </p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/comment-add.png" id="image_d5g_krs_mr"/>
      <u>Add Comment</u>
    </p>
    <p>Adds a comment to the selected part of the transliteration. This will be underlined
      yellow.</p>
    <p>You can also use these functions via the drop-down menu that appears when you click on the
      triangle to the right of the annotation symbols.</p>
    <p>The existing annotations are displayed in the <xref
        href="oberflaeche_annotationsfenster.dita">Annotation tab</xref> on the right. A new
      annotation will appear at the bottom of this list. With the arrow on the right you can expand
      the annotation and see more information as well as further editing options. </p>
    <p>You can delete the annotation by selecting it and clicking <image
        href="Images/icons/full/obj16/delete.png" id="image_b2z_jy4_sr"/>
      <u>Delete</u> in the upper right corner of the Annotations tab. A confirmation window will
      appear, click "Delete" to confirm or "Cancel" if you changed your mind.</p>
