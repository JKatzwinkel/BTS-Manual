 <conbody>
        <p>The Thesaurus view can be activated by clicking the <image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/thss.png" id="image_sfb_34b_qr"/> "Thesaurus" icon in
            the <xref href="oberflaeche_toolbar_e3.dita">Toolbar</xref>. Thesaurus compiles a
            controlled vocabulary, which is used for the metadata of the database objects like date,
            location, provenance, bibliographical references, etc. All terms of a thesaurus reflect
            a semantic network of concepts  including relationships between synonyms, broader and
            narrower (parent/child) contexts, and other related concepts. Thesaurus entries are
            offered in the Passport Editor window of the Text Editor and of the Lemma Editor and
            serve to select the metadata for Text Corpus Object, Texts or Lemma entries. New entries
            can be added here as well. Any user can see the contents of the Thesaurus view, but the
            right to create or modify them is restricted by the relevant user role. </p>
        <p>NOTE: This chapter provides a general description of the Workspace with its windows and
            tabs of the Thesaurus View. For a step-by-step instruction of how to enter or edit a new
            Thesaurus entry please refer to the relevant chapter in the User Guide section of this
            manual (<xref href="howto_thesaurus.dita"/>).</p>
        <p>If a Thesaurus entry you need is missing, please send a proposal to the BTS team in
            Berlin via E-mail: aegypt1@bbaw.de. </p>
        <p>The three windows from left to right are: Thesaurus Navigator, Passport Data Editor,
            Annotations.</p>
