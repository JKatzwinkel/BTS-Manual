    <p>Researcher may create new objects within a corpus. He/she can also edit or delete their own
      database objects only, or objects for which they were granted editing rights (Updater
      status).</p>

          database objects.</li>
        <li>Can assign reader/updater status for other users, but only if he/she has Updater
          status.</li>
        <li>Researcher can change his/her own status from an Updater to a Reader for a database
          object and thus lose his/her editing rights. He/She will not be able to upgrade the status
          again, i.e. to change back to the Updater.</li>
