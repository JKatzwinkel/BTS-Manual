    <p>Researcher may create new objects within a corpus. He/she can also edit or delete their own
      database objects only, or objects for which they were granted editing rights (Updater
      status).</p>
    <p><b>Rights</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_v25_l4v_bt">
        <li>Can add own database objects within a corpus.</li>
        <li>Can edit own database objects within a corpus, when given an Updater status in that
          corpus.</li>
        <li>Can assign reader/updater status for other users, but only for his or her own database
          objects.</li>
        <li>Researcher can change his/her own status from an Updater to a Reader for a database
          object and thus lose his/her editing rights. He / She will not be able to upgrade the
          status again, i.e. to change back to the Updater.
          <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,198,140"?>Also removing his
          status completely from an object with a visibility status <u>Reader, Group or Project</u>
          will not cause the object to become invisible.</li>

    <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_lwp_n4v_bt">
        <li>Cannot edit the already existing database objects within a corpus (created by other
          users) when a Reader or no status is assigned to him/her.</li>
        <li>If a text or an object within a corpus has a visibility status <u>Reader, Group or
            Project</u>, the Researcher will not be able to see the item unless he / she get obtains
          an Updater/Reader user status.</li>
