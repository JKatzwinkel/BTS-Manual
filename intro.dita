  <p>Welcome to Berlin Text System V 3.0 - a new version of the software, specially designed for
   editing Ancient Egyptian texts! Three major components of BTS - Text Editor, Lemma List and
   Thesaurus - complement each other to guarantee the extensive word processing of Ancient Egyptian.
   The back-end (technical side) and the user interface of the software have been completely
   redesigned, now including the new database structure (Couch DB), the new data format (JSON) and
   the new search engine (Elastic search). </p>
  <p>Text Editor provides the tools for transliteration, translation, lemmatization (assigning a
   lemma to a word), annotation and hieroglyphic transcription.</p>
  <p>Lemma List contains an up-to-date list of Ancient Egyptian and Demotic lemmata, accessible for
   any BTS user. The ability to modify the lemma list depends on the individual user rights. Each
   lemma has passport data, transliteration and translation, as well as annotations and comments
   attributed to it.</p>
  <p>Thesaurus compiles the formalized vocabulary (so-called "controlled vocabulary"), which is used
   for the metadata of the database objects. Thesaurus entries are offered in the Passport Editor
   section of the Text Corpus and Lemma views. </p>
  <p>The following User Manual provides the overview of the features now available in BTS V.3.0. </p>
