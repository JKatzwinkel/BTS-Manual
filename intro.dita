  <p>Welcome to Berlin Text System V 3.0 - a new version of the software, specially designed for
   editing Ancient Egyptian texts! Its three major components - Text Editor, Lemma List and
   Thesaurus - complement each other to guarantee the extensive word processing of Ancient Egyptian.
   The back-end (technical side) and the user interface of the software have been completely
   redesigned, now including the new database structure (Couch DB), the data format (JSON) and
   search engine (Elastic search). </p>
  <p>Text Editor provides tools for transliteration, translation, lemmatization (assigning a lemma
   to a word), annotation and hieroglyphic transcription.</p>
  <p>Lemma List contains an up-to-date list of Ancient Egyptian and Demotic lemmata, accessible for
   any BTS user. The ability to modify the lemma list depends on the individual user rights. Each
   lemma has passport data, transliteration and translation, as well as annotations and comments
   attributed to it.</p>
  <p>Thesaurus compiles the formalized vocabulary (also called "controlled vocabulary"), which is
   used for the metadata of the database objects. Thesaurus entries are offered in the Passport
   Editor section of the Text Corpus and Lemma views. </p>
  <p>User Manual offers the overview of the features now available in BTS. </p>
