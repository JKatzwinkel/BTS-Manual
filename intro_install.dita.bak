  <conbody>
    <p/>
    <p><u><b>Preparing the installation</b></u></p>
    <p>Extract the BTS programm package you received into the directory of your choice. It should
      contain the following files: </p>
    <p>- Installer (.exe-file)</p>
    <p>- Readme (.txt-file) </p>
    <p>- Manual (.pdf-file) </p>
    <p>- Keyman Keyboard (aaew.kmx) </p>
    <p>- BBAW Libertine Font (BBAWLibertine_ah.ttf) </p>
    <p><u><b> Note</b></u>: We recommend to create and use the "standard" directory on "C" drive:
      "c:\bts". </p>
    <p><u><b>Installing BTS</b></u></p>
    <p>Double-click "bts.exe". The "BTS Installation Wizard" will start. Fill out the required
      fields in the following steps: </p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_vlk_qsj_2s">
        <li><u>Database Installation Settings</u><p>
            <ul id="ul_y51_mtj_2s">
              <li><i>Database Installation Directory</i>: A standard location is automatically
                entered here refering to: "C:\bts\dbdir". In case you have extracted your
                bts-archive to another directory you will have to change the path to "dbdir" here.
                Click "Browse File System..." to determine the directory path of your BTS.</li>
              <li><i>Http Port of your CouchDB on Localhost</i>: Enter the port number used by the
                CouchDB service. Default number is 9086.</li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
        <li><u>Welcome to the Berlin Text System Installation</u><p>
            <ul id="ul_x14_b5j_2s">
              <li><i>Do you have a BTS Server URL?</i>: Click "Yes" if you want your data to be
                shared and synchronized with BTS server. Click "No" if you don't have access to BTS
                server and are going to work in the "standalone" mode. Button "Next" will be
                activated only if you select one of the options. </li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
        <li><u>Server Connection</u><p>
            <ul id="ul_srb_d5j_2s">
              <li><i>Server URL</i>: Enter the URL of the server that you have access to. Standard
                BTS Server address (including the port number) is: http://aaew64.bbaw.de:9588</li>
              <li><i>Your User Name</i>: Enter the user name you received from BTS team. </li>
              <li><i>Your Password for Authentication</i>: Enter your password.<p/>After entering
                the information required, click "Connect to server". In the upper part of the window
                the status information will appear "The connection you have entered is OK". Note
                that the button "Finish" is only activated if connection was successful. </li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
        <li><u>Select Projects to Load</u><p>
            <ul id="ul_b1c_g5j_2s">
              <li><i>Select your main working project</i>: The default option is "Altägyptisches
                Wörterbuch BBAW". Another option is "Demotic".</li>
              <li><i>Further projects from which you want to load and read data</i>: Select a
                project from "Available Projects" (left text box) and click "Add" to add a project.
                The project should then appear in the right text box. </li>
            </ul>
          </p></li>
        <li><u>Finish Installation of BTS</u><p>Click "Finish" to finalize the installation. After
            the installation, the programm will automatically start and the "Database Manager"
            window will open . If Windows asks you to grant "bts.exe" access to the system, confirm
            it. </p><p/><p><u>NOTE</u>: Although the "Database Manager" window automatically opens
            after the installation is finished, BTS is still importing the data from the server.
            This process will take another 20 minutes and is not visible to the user. Close the
            "Database manager" window and reopen it in approximately 20 minutes. As soon as the
            "aaew_wlist" displays the number 48500 in "DB Doc Count" column, the process is
            completed. </p><p><u>NOTE</u>: Sometimes the automatic log-in does not work after the
            installation &amp; restart. As the result "No user logged in" and "No role" will be
            initially displayed on the BTS tool bar. In this case, start the programm again and
            log-in with your user name and password. </p><p/></li>
        <li><u>Index data</u><p/>Last but not least. All data imported from the server, should be
          indexed. Indexing speeds up the search, whereas the quiery is done not in the database
          (which would take up time), but in the indexes of documents. <p/>In the upper left corner
          of the "Database manager" window click on "Reindex all" . The indexing process will start
          and may take up to 20 minutes. If indexing has been completed correctly, the corpus color
          will change from red to green. If indexing was not successful for some corpora try
          re-indexing them by clicking on the button "Re-index all non-OK". </li>
      </ol>
