  <title>Passport Editor</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>The Passport Editor section is located in the bottom part in the middle of the Text Corpus
      view. It contains the metadata of a selected database object. It is divided into different
      subsections which are organized in tabs. These categories vary depending on the database
      object: Text Corpus Objects have other tab than Texts. </p>
    <p>If you are working on a "child object" and want it to have the same metadata as the "parent
      object", you can click <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/inherit.png"
        id="image_fdk_2rt_mr"/> "Inherit Passport Data" in the top right corner of the Passport
      Editor. Note that the "parent" data will be copied in the empty fields only. If the fields
      were filled out, their content will remain unchanged. </p>
    <p>The option "Inherit Overwrite Passport Data", available via the drop-down menu "<image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/options_dreieck.png" id="image_umy_spv_ps"/>" allows you to
      overwrite already existing metadata with updates metadata of the "parent object".</p>
    <p>NOTE: Both inheritance procedures apply to all tabs at once, not only the currently open one. </p>
    <p>NOTE: Be sure that all entered metadata are correct, as you might inherit errors to "child
      objects".</p>
    <p>NOTE: It is not possible to undo the inheritance procedure.</p>
