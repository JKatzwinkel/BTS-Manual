  <title>Adjusting display</title>
  <body>
    <p>BTS is flexible in the location and display of individual tabs within it, but changes in the
      display and arrangement of tabs cannot be saved. Every restart of BTS restores the default
      settings.</p>
    <p><b>Minimizing/Maximizing</b></p>
    <p>Most tabs can be minimized or maximized by clicking these two buttons: <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/minimize.png" id="image_mry_1y2_1v"/> and <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/maximize.png" id="image_bns_by2_1v"/> respectively. When
      you have maximized or minimized one or several tabs of the workspace (Corpus Navigator, Text
      Editor, etc.), the respective icons will appear on the right or left side of the program
      window. For explanations of the icons see <xref href="ui_window.dita"/>. Sometimes it might be
      necessary to return to the "Window"-entry on the Menu bar to restore the tabs by clicking on
      "Open Text Editor" etc.</p>
    <p>This example shows the maximized Text Editor. Other tabs are minimized and displayed as icons
      on the right and left (marked by a red rectangle). To restore minimized tabs, click either
      their icon or restore <image href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/restore.png"
        id="image_eyc_dff_1v"/> icon above it.</p>

    <p><b>Closing Tabs</b></p>
    <p>Apart from the Navigator, most of the tabs can be closed by clicking <image
        href="Images/icons/extra%20icons/close.png" id="image_hfc_l2t_2x"/>. You can restore the
      closed tab via the dropdown menu "Window" in the menu bar. Restarting BTS will restore all
      closed tabs as well.</p>
    <p><b>Moving tabs</b></p>
    <p>If you do not like the default arrangement of the BTS tabs, most of them can be moved (some
      have to stay together, like all the sub-tabs of the Text Editor: Transliteration, Sign Text
      Editor and JSesh View, all the sub-tabs of the Passport Editor and the sub-tabs of the Corpus
      Navigator: Text Corpora and Trash). You can grab a tab and just pull it to a different location
      within the workspace. Below is an example of rearranged sections. Annotations have been moved
      next to the Corpus Navigator, Translation is placed below it, and Text Editor no longer
      central. </p>

        id="image_xxg_pgf_1v"/></p>
    <p>It is also possible to pull an entire tab completely out of the program window. See
      screenshot below for an example. The tabs that have been removed from the program and now have
      individual windows cannot be put back in. You will have to restart the BTS in order to have
      the default view again.</p>
    <p>NOTE: When you remove the last window from the program window, all windows will disappear. You
      need to restart BTS to restore the display.</p>
