  <p>To get to the "Preferences" window, click either <image
    href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_ilm_dg1_nr"/> in the left part of the
   toolbar or > <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_svd_hg1_nr"/>
   "Preferences..." in the drop-down menu of "Preferences" in the Menu bar.</p>
  <p>On the left you can choose between "Berlin Text System General" and "EgyDsl" .</p>
  <p><b><u>Berlin Text System General</u></b></p>
  <p>Expanding the "Berlin Text System General" will present the following options: </p>
  <p><u>Abstract Text Settings</u></p>
  <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>
  <p><?oxy_custom_end?><i>(explain)</i></p>
  <p><u>Configuration</u></p>
  <p>Currently the only available option is "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch (AAEW) (10)". Click "Apply"
   to use this configuration. Click "Restore Default" to go back to the default configuration. </p>
  <p><u>Corpus Settings</u></p>
  <p/>
  <p>Here you can choose a set of corpora you are going to work with. Every corpus that does not
   appear in the "Active corpora" list on the right won't be accessed by BTS. To activate a corpus
   select it in the left list and then click "Add". To remove the corpus from your working list,
   select it and click "Remove". "Add all" / "Remove all" will add or remove all available corpora
   to or from the "Active Corpora" list. </p>
  <p/>
  <p>The check-box "Activate to select main working corpus" has a specific function.  If it is
   activated all new text or objects created in the "Corpus Navigator" window will be physically
   saved in the selected corpus. For example in the "Corpus Navigator" you have selected "Corpus 2",
   but your main working corpus is "Copus 1". The new object will be <i>physically</i> saved in
   Corpus 1, although in the Corpus Navigator it is displayed as a part of "Corpus 2". </p>
  <p><u>Corpus Navigator Settings</u>
  </p>
  <p>- Check box "Corpus Navigator sort by sort key". By default, all objects on the same level have
   "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a "SortKey" in the Passport data
   of the object will change its position regarding other objects, "0" being on top. </p>
  <p>"Default Visibility". Applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a
   corpus will have by default after its creation.</p>
  <p>"Default Review State". Applies to all newly created objects. Like the "Default Visibility"
   above, this defines a review state which a corpus will have directly after its creation.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Lemma List Settings </u>
  </p>
  <p>Here you can choose a project with a main working lemma list. All new lemmas will be saved in
   this project. You can currently either choose from "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW" or
   "Demotic".</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Lemma Navigator Settings</u></p>
  <p>- Check box "Lemma Navigator sort by sort key". Per default all objects on the same level have
   "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a "SortKey" in the Passport data
   of the object will change its position relevant to other objects, "0" being on top. </p>
  <p>"Default Visibility". Applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a lemma
   will have by default after its creation.</p>
  <p>"Default Review State". Applies to all newly created objects. Like the "Default Visibility"
   above, this defines a review state which a lemma will have directly after its creation.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Lemmatizer</u>
  </p>
  <p>The Lemmatizer allows you to set a default inflection (the programmes default inflection is
   "3") and activate the check box "Automatically select first lemma proposal". More on grammatical
   rules see <xref href="howto_Grammatikfehler_e5.dita#topic_f5w_3z5_kr"/>. </p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Project settings</u>
  </p>
  <p>Here you can choose your main working project from the drop-down menu. The field below gives
   you an option to choose further projects from which you want to load and read data. In the box on
   the left is a list of available projects. Clicking on one will give you an option to "Add" it to
   the "Projects to be downloaded" on the right. Clicking on "Apply" below will download the
   project. Between the two fields you also have an option to remove the project from the right
   field and to "Add All" from available to to-be-downloaded and "Remove All" from to-be-downloaded
   to available. Next to the "Apply" button there is also one that will restore default settings
   "Restore Default".</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Remember me</u></p>
  <p>Select the checkbox "Remember my login credentials on startup" to be logged in automatically,
   when starting BTS.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Text Editor</u></p>
  <p>- "Activate mouse-over pop-up with information on lemmata". Activating this option will display
   the lemmatization information about the selected lemma in the Text editor. </p>
  <p>- "Show line number ruler on left side". This checkbox activates the line numbering (of the
   window) in the <b>Text editor</b>. </p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Sign Text Editor</u>
  </p>
  <p>Defines elements displayed in the lemma-boxes while editing tokens inside the Sign Text Editor.
   Additionally, the line width can be adjusted.</p>
  <p>The applied changes will be visible upon refreshing the view of the "Sign Text Editor" tab. </p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Thesaurus Settings</u>
  </p>
  <p>Here you can choose a project with a main working thesaurus. All new thesaurus entries will be
   saved there. You can currently either choose from "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW" or
   "Demotic".</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Thesaurus Navigator Settings</u></p>
  <p>- Check box "Ths Navigator sort by sort key". Per default all objects on the same level have "0"
   as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Defining a "SortKey" in the Passport data of
   the object will change its position relevant to other objects, "0" being on top. </p>
  <p>"Default Visibility". Applies to all newly created objects. Defines a visibility status a
   thesaurus entry will have by default after its creation.</p>
  <p>"Default Review State". Applies to all newly created objects. Like the "Default Visibility"
   above, this defines a review state which a thesaurus entry will have directly after its
   creation.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><b><u>EgyDsl</u></b></p>
  <p>In the "EgyDsl" menu entry you can change the appearance of your BTS: different colours and
   scripts ("Syntax Colouring": currently inactive) and import, edit and apply Templates.</p>
  <p/>
  <p><u>Templates</u></p>
  <p>This window offers you a functionality to create templates to make the transliteration input
   easier. For example, you can define a special marking for ambivalent words. While
   transliterating, right right-click and select "Content assist". Your template will be displayed
   at the end of the list. Double click on it - it will be automatically inserted into the text. </p>
