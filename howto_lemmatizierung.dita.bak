 <title>5. Lemmatizing and encoding inflections</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>To lemmatize a transcribed text the lemmatizer is used. It can be found in the <xref
        href="oberflaeche_passporteditor.dita"/> part of the BTS.</p>
    <p>Click the second header <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemmatizer.png"
        id="image_dhr_pqv_nr"/> "Lemmatizer" in this part of the screen and select the "Sign-Text
      Editor" view below the Text Editor window: </p>
    <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,198,140"?>
    <p>Images/Lemmatizer.png</p>
    <?oxy_custom_end?>
    <p>You can see several fields:</p>
    <p>The first white rectangle "Selected Word" displays the word that you have activated by
      clicking (in our example: pn). In this example it has already been lemmatized, so the other
      fields are filled: </p>
    <p/>
    <p>If you find out that you have made an error in the transcription, you can modify it in the
      "Selected Word" field and it will be altered in the Sign-Text-Editor and the Transliteration
      Editor automatically.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><u>"Lemma"</u> provides the lemma number from the lemma list. Next to it, the selected lemma
      should be displayed. To select a lemma, click on the appropriate/correct suggestion in the
      field below. </p>
    <p><u>"Flexion"</u> shows the code referring to the grammatical form of the inflection of the
      selected word. <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?></p>
    <?oxy_custom_end?>
    <p>In the field "Translation" you can choose one or several fitting translations from the lower
      field (in the example there is only one option, but there can be more). Make sure to have
      selected the right language in the dropdown menu to the right. Your default language is the
      one connected with your login data. Choose several available translations by left clicking and
      holding CTRL at the same time. If none of the options seems fitting to you, you can enter your
      own translation as well. </p>
    <p>If you cannot find a lemma, click the magnifying glass and search for it in the lemma list. </p>
    <p>To go to the next lemmatizable lemma, either click<image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-ok.png" id="image_pd2_53w_nr"/> "Confirm current lemma
      editing and continue to next lemma" or ">" on the right above the lemmatizer. ">|" brings you
      to the end of the line and >|| to the end of the text.</p>
    <p>Only white marked objects in the Sign Text Editor are lemmata and can be lemmatized. </p>
