 <title>2. Translation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can enter the translation of individual sentences in the text input field "Sentence
            translation" of the text editor. This window will remain deactivated (greyed out) during
            transliteration, until you press the button <image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-load.png" id="image_ynz_vnc_xt"/> "Load Text
            Lemmata" or until you have switched between the Text Editor and the Sign Text
            Editor.</p>
  <p>Make sure to have selected the right language of your translation in the drop-down menu on the
            right (<image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_krw_wmv_nr"/> : de,
            en, fr, es, ru). The default language of your choice can be set up in the <xref
                href="oberflaeche_preferences.dita">Preferences</xref>. In the standard view only
            one line will be visible.</p>
        <p>Extend the text editor window and scroll up and down if the sentence contains more than
            one line. The complete translation of the text will appear on the right of your BTS
            screen in the "Text translation" section (this usually needs refreshing the view, e.g.
            by clicking in the Corpus Navigator and reopening the selected text). Clicking on a
            sentence here will highlight it and the same sentence will be underlined in the
            "Transliteration" subsection. You will have to enter the translation sentence by
            sentence (designated in the transliteration with §§). </p>
        <p>Within a complete egyptian grammatical sentence, it is possible to segment the
            translation by using the return-Taste. The input of the complete translation as a
            running text is not possible. Enter only one translation for each sentence, as the
            selection of languages is not intended for multilingual translations of one and the same
            text.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Before you enter your translation, be sure that the relevant sentence is activated.
            The activation is indicated by the sign <image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_szd_1fs_2x"/> in the Text
            Editor direcly to the left of the relevant sentence. If the sign does not show up, your
            translation will not be saved. </p>
